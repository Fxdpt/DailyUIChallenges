# DailyUI 2

This project was created for [Daily UI Challenge #02]([dailyui.co](https://www.dailyui.co/))

### Rules

Design a credit card checkout form or page. Don't forget the important elements such as the numbers, dates, security numbers, etc.

### Description

I used Materialize Framework for generating the card element and the form. This Challenge don't really attract me so much so i decided to finish it quick (maybe too much ?) to be ready for Challenge #03 !
