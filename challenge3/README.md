# DailyUI 3

This project was created for [Daily UI Challenge #03]([dailyui.co](https://www.dailyui.co/))

### Rules

Landing Page : What's the main focus? Is it for a book, an album, a mobile app, a product? Consider important landing page elements (call-to-actions, clarity, etc.)

### Description

I've planned to create a very lightweight landing page for a fictionnal CSS/JS Framework. I'm not really confident and experimented with transition / transformation and all that stuff, so that was a great practice !
